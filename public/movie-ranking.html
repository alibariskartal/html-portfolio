<h1>The Best Movies According to Barış</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
<p>This movie tells you how important it is to let your child whatever he/she wants to be.</p>
<h3>Shawshank's Redemption</h3>
<p>This movie is about friendship and freedom. If you dont get rid of your chains it doesnt matter if you are in a jail or not.</p>
<h3>Pianist</h3>
<p>This one is about discrimination among people. Racism and survival story of a pianist.</p>
